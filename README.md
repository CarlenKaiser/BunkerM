## 🔍 What is BunkerM?

BunkerM is an open-source, containerized MQTT management solution that bundles together a Mosquitto broker with a comprehensive web interface. It provides a complete, ready-to-deploy MQTT environment with built-in management capabilities, eliminating the need for separate broker setup and configuration.

![Dashboard Screenshot](docs/assets/images/dashboard.png)

This all-in-one solution features dynamic security controls, real-time monitoring, client activity logging, and cloud integration capabilities. The entire stack - Mosquitto broker, backend services, and frontend UI - comes pre-configured in Docker containers for easy deployment and management.

<a id="quick-start-with-docker"></a>
## 🚀 Quick Start with Docker  

Get up and running in seconds with **BunkerM**!  

### 1. Run the Docker Container  

Make sure to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your machine before running the command below:

```bash
docker run -d -p 1900:1900 -p 2000:2000 bunkeriot/bunkerm
```

This command:
- Runs BunkerM in detached mode (`-d`)
- Maps the MQTT broker port to 1900 (`-p 1900:1900`)
- Maps the Web UI port to 2000 (`-p 2000:2000`)
- Uses the official BunkerM image (`bunkeriot/bunkerm`)

### Persistent Data Deployment

For production environments, you'll want to persist your data across container restarts:

```bash
docker run -d -p 1900:1900 -p 2000:2000 \
  -v mosquitto_data:/var/lib/mosquitto \
  -v mosquitto_conf:/etc/mosquitto \
  -v auth_data:/data \
  bunkeriot/bunkerm
```

This command adds:
- A volume for Mosquitto data (`-v mosquitto_data:/var/lib/mosquitto`)
- A volume for authentication data (`-v auth_data:/data`)

### Remote Access Installation

If you need to access BunkerM from outside the host machine:

```bash
docker run -d -p 1900:1900 -p 2000:2000 \
  -e HOST_ADDRESS=<HOST_IP> \
  bunkeriot/bunkerm
```

Replace `<HOST_IP>` with your host machine's IP address or domain name.

### 2. Access the Interface

- Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:2000`
- The BunkerM web interface will load directly without any security warnings

### 3. Connect to the MQTT Broker

- **Default port:** `1900`
- **Make sure to add a new MQTT client** from the UI (**Client Accounts** menu) to connect to the broker.

## 💰 Community vs Paid versions

My mission with BunkerM is to democratize IoT by making MQTT management accessible to everyone. The Community Version is designed to be lightweight, easy to use, and completely free, offering essential features for individuals and small projects.

However, to sustain the development of the Community Version and continue delivering value, I'm introducing Pro and Enterprise Versions. These versions are tailored for businesses and advanced users, offering additional features like:

- Local authentication (no internet required)  
- Fine-grained RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
- LDAP and SSO integrations
- Advanced monitoring and analytics
- Enterprise-grade support

The revenue from the Pro and Enterprise versions will directly support the development and maintenance of the free Community Version. This way, I can keep BunkerM accessible to everyone while also meeting the needs of larger organizations.

If the open-source community shows enough support, I may consider making the Pro version free as well. Your feedback and contributions are invaluable in shaping the future of BunkerM!
